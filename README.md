## About

The **Health Companion App** is a mobile health management application designed for individuals living with chronic conditions. It helps users manage medications and appointments through an adaptive, accessibility-first interface without the notification fatigue or complexity that causes most health apps to be abandoned.

**Key features:**
- ✅ Medication confirmation with timestamps (solves "Did I take it?")
- 📅 Smart appointment scheduling with calendar-aware clustering
- 📷 OCR pill bottle scanning for frictionless onboarding
- 👨‍👩‍👧 Caregiver sharing with granular permissions
- 🌙 "Bad Day Mode" for flare-ups and tough days
- ♿ Three adaptive interface modes: Simple / Standard / Advanced
