## Overview

| | |
|---|---|
| **Type** | Mobile Health Application (iOS) |
| **Timeline** | January–February 2026 |
| **My Role** | UX Researcher & Designer (solo project) |
| **Research** | 10 interviews + 50 surveys = 60 participants |
| **Deliverable** | Figma clickable prototype (~25–30 screens) |

The **Health Companion App** is a mobile application designed to help individuals with chronic health conditions manage their medications and appointments — without the cognitive overload, notification fatigue, or accessibility barriers that plague existing solutions.

---

## The Problem

Millions of people living with chronic conditions manage complicated daily health routines while also maintaining careers, families, and lives. The tools available to them are fundamentally broken:

- 📦 **Pill organizers** don't tell you *if* you already took your medication
- 🔔 **Phone alarms** become background noise after a week
- 📱 **Existing health apps** overwhelm users with notifications until they abandon them
- 📋 **Paper calendars** can't prevent double-booking across multiple specialists

The consequences are real:

> **76% of people with chronic conditions miss medications at least sometimes.**  
> The #1 reason? They forgot.

And appointment management is, in the words of one participant, *"a logistical nightmare"* — especially when coordinating between 3–5 different specialists who don't communicate with each other.

### The Gap

Most health apps make one of two mistakes: they're either too simple (just a glorified alarm) or too complex (overwhelming dashboards full of features nobody asked for). Neither solves the real problems people face every day.

---

## The Solution

The Health Companion App takes a different approach: **adaptive design**.

Rather than building one interface for an imaginary "average user," the app offers three modes:

| Mode | For | Key Design Choices |
|---|---|---|
| 🟢 **Simple** | Tech beginners, seniors | 60pt+ touch targets, 24pt font, voice reminders, one task per screen |
| 🔵 **Standard** | Everyday users | Calendar integration, smart notifications, quick-tap logging |
| ⚫ **Advanced** | Power users | Data visualization, health exports, symptom trend analysis |

**Core features across all modes:**
- ✅ Medication confirmation with timestamps (solves "did I take it?")
- 📅 Smart appointment scheduling with clustering
- 📷 OCR pill bottle scanning for easy onboarding
- 👨‍👩‍👧 Caregiver sharing with granular permissions
- 🌙 "Bad Day Mode" for flare-ups and tough days

---

## Research

### Methodology

I used two complementary research methods to gather both qualitative depth and quantitative scale:

| Method | Participants | Duration | Format |
|---|---|---|---|
| Semi-structured interviews | 10 | 30–45 min | Video calls |
| Online surveys | 50 | 5–7 min | Health forums & patient advocacy groups |

**Total: 60 participants**

Participant breakdown:
- **Ages:** 18–75+ (interviews: 29–73)
- **Gender:** 60% female, 40% male
- **Conditions:** Hypertension (56%), Diabetes (44%), Arthritis (28%), Heart Disease (24%)
- **Tech proficiency:** Expert 20% / Comfortable 36% / Basic 32% / Beginner 12%
- **Medications:** Average of 5–6 per day

---

### What the Interviews Revealed

I conducted a 19-question semi-structured interview covering medication habits, appointment management, technology usage, and health concerns. The conversations were revealing — not just for *what* people said, but for the emotion behind it:

> *"I'll stand there staring at the organizer wondering, 'Did I take these already?' It's scary because with my blood pressure medication, you can't double up."*  
> — Margaret Chen, 68

> *"I've tried probably six different medication apps. They all start out great, but then the notifications become overwhelming."*  
> — James Rodriguez, 42

> *"I have to go to an infusion center once a month for my MS medication. It's a three-hour appointment... scheduling it is a logistical nightmare."*  
> — Sarah Patel, 36

> *"On my worst days, I can barely get out of bed. I need something really easy to use even when I'm in brain fog."*  
> — Emily Nguyen, 45

**Top pain points (out of 10 interviews):**

| Pain Point | Reported by |
|---|---|
| Medication adherence | 10/10 |
| Appointment coordination | 9/10 |
| Fragmented systems | 7/10 |
| Accessibility needs | 6/10 |
| Notification fatigue | 3/10 |

---

### What the Survey Revealed

50 survey respondents confirmed and quantified what the interviews suggested:

#### Medication Adherence

```
76% miss medications at least sometimes
76% cite forgetting as the primary reason
64% rely on memory/routine (which fails them)
28% confused about dosage or timing
```

#### Feature Priorities (Top 3 Selections)

| Feature | Selected By |
|---|---|
| Medication reminders | **88%** |
| Appointment reminders | **76%** |
| Medication tracking/history | 56% |
| Doctor communication | 44% |
| Refill reminders | 40% |
| Health data tracking | 32% |

#### Accessibility & Privacy

```
64% — need large text / simple navigation (essential or very important)
56% — have some form of accessibility need
72% — very or extremely concerned about health data privacy
```

---

### 8 Key Research Insights

From the combined 60-participant study, eight core findings guided every design decision:

1. **Medication adherence is multifaceted** — Not just forgetting; confirmation, timing, and identification are all problems.
2. **Notification fatigue is real** — Users abandon apps that over-notify.
3. **One size does NOT fit all** — 44% beginner/basic vs. 20% expert users demand an adaptive interface.
4. **Appointment management is a logistical nightmare** — 40% have 7+ appointments/year.
5. **Healthcare is fragmented** — 8/10 participants see multiple providers who don't communicate.
6. **Accessibility is essential, not optional** — 56% have real accessibility needs.
7. **Trust and privacy are non-negotiable** — 72% very/extremely concerned about data.
8. **Caregiver support is critical** — 32% rely on family members for medication help.

   😟         😰          🙂            😊           ❤️          🌟
```

**The killer moment:** Stage 6. Margaret opens the app at 10:00 AM wondering if she took her pills. She gets an instant answer: *"Morning medications — All taken ✓ 7:05 AM."* Her anxiety dissolves in seconds. This single feature — immediate, timestamped confirmation — became the central value proposition for the Simplicity Seeker segment.

---

### Sarah's 7-Stage Journey

Sarah's journey is driven by **efficiency** and discovering that the app can actually **learn her life**.

| Stage | Scenario | Emotion | Design Response |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Discovery | Searching "best medication tracking app" during lunch | Frustrated → Analytical | Impressed by integration list |
| 2. Onboarding | Downloads during subway commute | Rushed → Impressed | Google sign-in + OCR = under 10 min setup |
| 3. First Day | Busy workday with back-to-back meetings | Relieved → Hopeful | App delays reminder until meeting ends |
| 4. Week 1 | Discovers data insights before neurologist visit | Surprised → Curious | "My fatigue is worse on days with more meetings" |
| **5. Key Moment** ⭐ | Needs to schedule infusion + neurologist + lab | **Frustrated → Amazed** | App clusters 3 appointments, saves 2 hours travel |
| 6. Bad Day | Severe MS fatigue + brain fog | Anxious → Supported | One tap → simplified interface + husband notified |
| 7. Long-term | Power user, 97% adherence, sends feature feedback | Satisfied → Engaged | "Less time managing health, more time with kids" |

**Sarah's Emotional Arc:**
```
Frustrated → Impressed → Satisfied → Surprised → Delighted → Grateful → Advocate
    😤          😲          🙂          😲          🌟          ❤️          🎯
```

**The killer moment:** Stage 5. Sarah needs to schedule three separate medical appointments while her work calendar is packed. The app analyzes her calendar, finds the optimal day, and clusters all three appointments — saving her two hours of travel. This appointment clustering feature became the defining value for the Busy Balancer segment.

## Storyboards

### Storyboard 1: Margaret's Morning Medication Routine

**Panel 1 — The Reminder**
Margaret is making breakfast at 7:00 AM. Her phone activates a voice reminder: *"Time for your medication, Margaret."* It reads the medication name aloud.

**Panel 2 — Checking the App**
She opens the app. She sees a large photo of her medication alongside "Metformin 500mg." She can verify it visually against the pill bottle. *"Is this the right pill?"*

**Panel 3 — Confirmation & Peace**
She taps the large green **"I TOOK IT"** button. A green checkmark appears: *"✓ Logged 7:05 AM."* She feels reassured for the rest of the day.

**Features demonstrated:** Voice reminder → visual pill photo → oversized action button → timestamp confirmation

---

### Storyboard 2: Sarah's Appointment Scheduling

**Panel 1 — The Frustration**
Sarah has three appointments to schedule: infusion, neurologist, and lab work. Her work calendar is completely packed. *"When do I even fit all of this in??"*

**Panel 2 — The App Suggests**
The app syncs with her Google Calendar and analyzes her schedule. It surfaces: *"💡 Best day: Friday, Feb 28. Cluster 3 appointments?"* Sarah: *"Wait, it analyzed my calendar!"*

**Panel 3 — Success & Relief**
All three appointments are confirmed on the same day. *"✓ 3 appointments scheduled. Saved 2 hours travel time."* Automatic reminders and preparation checklists are created.

**Features demonstrated:** Calendar integration → intelligent clustering → time savings visualization → auto-generated preparation checklists

## Wireframes

The design system was built before any screens, ensuring consistency across all three modes.

### Design System

**Color Palette**

| Color | Hex | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| Primary Blue | `#4A90E2` | Actions, links, primary buttons |
| Success Green | `#4CAF50` | Taken status, confirmations |
| Warning Yellow | `#FFC107` | Upcoming medications, attention |
| Error Red | `#F44336` | Missed doses, critical alerts |
| Text Primary | `#212121` | Body text |
| Background | `#FFFFFF` | Screen background |
| Surface | `#F5F5F5` | Cards, elevated surfaces |

**Typography by Mode**

| Element | Simple Mode | Standard Mode | Advanced Mode |
|---|---|---|---|
| Body text | 18–24pt | 16pt | 14pt |
| Headings | 32pt+ | 24pt | 20pt |
| Minimum | 18pt | 14pt | 12pt |

**Touch Targets**
- Simple Mode: 60×60pt minimum, 80×80pt for primary actions
- Standard Mode: 44×44pt minimum (Apple HIG standard)
- Accessibility: WCAG AA (4.5:1 contrast ratio) throughout

---

### Screen 1 — Welcome & Mode Selection

![Welcome & Mode Selection](wireframes/1frame.png)

Three mode cards are presented at launch with clear plain-language descriptions. A "Need help? Invite a family member" option supports caregiver-assisted setup for users like Margaret.

*Research basis: 73% of participants worried about app complexity on first use.*

---

### Screen 2 — Home Dashboard

![Home Dashboard](wireframes/2frame.png)

The home screen opens with a personalized greeting and puts "Today's Medications" at the very top — because that's the question users are asking the moment they open the app. Color-coded status indicators and timestamps eliminate all ambiguity.

*Research basis: Solving the #1 "Did I take it?" question in under 5 seconds.*

---

### Screen 3 — Home Dashboard (Alternate View)

![Home Dashboard Alternate](wireframes/3frame.png)

The Quick Actions 2×2 grid offers fast navigation to My Health, Appointments, Settings, and Help — accessible without hunting through menus.

---

### Screen 4 — Medication List

![Medication List](wireframes/4frame.png)

Each medication card shows a photo for visual identification, special instructions (e.g., "Take with food"), and a color-coded status indicator. Filter chips help users browse by All / Daily / As-needed / Weekly.

*Research basis: 6/10 interview participants struggled to identify their medications by name alone.*

---

### Screen 5 — Add Medication (OCR Scan)

![Add Medication](wireframes/5frame.png)

A dual-input system defaults to camera scanning. The OCR reader auto-detects medication name, dosage, and form from the pill bottle — eliminating the high-error-rate manual text entry that causes incorrect medication records.

---

### Screen 6 — Medication Reminder

![Medication Reminder](wireframes/6frame.png)

The reminder screen has one dominant action: a full-width green **"I TOOK IT"** button. The medication photo is large and prominent. Secondary options (Snooze 15 min, Skip this dose) are visually de-emphasized to reduce accidental taps. A 30-second undo window catches mistakes.

*Research basis: Single large CTA reduces cognitive load for Margaret; immediate confirmation reduces anxiety.*

---

### Screen 7 — Daily Medication Log

![Daily Medication Log](wireframes/7frame.png)

The log page opens with the instant answer at the top: *"All medications taken ✓"* or a specific count of what's pending. A timeline layout (Morning / Afternoon / Evening) with timestamps makes the full picture clear. Adherence percentage is celebrated positively.

---

### Screen 8 — Appointment List

![Appointment List](wireframes/8frame.png)

Appointment cards include auto-generated preparation checklists (bring insurance card, medication list, notes for doctor). Multi-stage reminders (3 days, 1 day, morning-of) are configured automatically by appointment type.

---

### Screen 9 — Smart Appointment Scheduling

![Appointment Scheduling](wireframes/9frame.png)

The scheduling assistant analyzes the user's work calendar to suggest optimal appointment days. When multiple appointments are needed, it proposes clustering them to save travel time and displays concrete savings: *"💰 Save 2 hrs travel" / "💰 Save $15 parking."*

*Research basis: Sarah's #1 pain point — coordination across 4+ specialists.*

---

### Screen 10 — Settings & Accessibility

![Settings & Accessibility](wireframes/10frame.png)

Mode switching, text size with live preview, high contrast and voice command toggles, and caregiver connection management — all surfaced clearly without hiding critical features in nested menus.

---

## Prototype

The clickable prototype was built in **Figma** targeting the **iPhone 14 Pro** (393×852pt).

| | |
|---|---|
| **Total screens** | ~25–30 frames |
| **Interactive hotspots** | ~50–70 clickable elements |
| **Transitions** | Smart Animate, Dissolve, Slide |

### Four Complete User Flows

**Flow 1: First-Time Onboarding** (8 screens)  
`Welcome → Mode Selection → Profile → Add Medications (OCR) → Scan Result → Notification Prefs → Success → Home`

**Flow 2: Medication Management** (5 screens)  
`Home → Medication List → Add Medication → Reminder → Logged Confirmation`

**Flow 3: Appointment Scheduling** (7 screens)  
`Appointments → Add Appointment → Smart Date Suggestions → Clustering Proposal → Optimized Schedule → Booking → Success`

**Flow 4: Settings & Accessibility** (3 screens)  
`Settings Menu → Mode Selection → Invite Caregiver`

---

## Key Design Decisions

Each major design element traces directly back to a specific research finding:

### Decision 1: Adaptive Three-Mode Interface
**Research trigger:** 44% beginner/basic users vs. 20% expert users  
**Problem:** A single interface would compromise the experience for both extremes  
**Solution:** Mode selection at onboarding, switchable at any time in Settings  
**Impact:** Margaret gets a screen with 3 options max; Sarah gets data dashboards

### Decision 2: Timestamped Confirmation System
**Research trigger:** 10/10 interview participants experienced "Did I take it?" anxiety  
**Problem:** No current solution provides undeniable proof of medication taken  
**Solution:** Every logged dose gets a permanent timestamp shown on the home dashboard  
**Impact:** Margaret's core anxiety is resolved within 3 seconds of opening the app

### Decision 3: Smart (Not Dumb) Notifications
**Research trigger:** 3/10 participants had abandoned apps specifically due to notification overload  
**Problem:** Generic alarms get ignored; too many reminders cause abandonment  
**Solution:** Escalating reminders (gentle → persistent), calendar-context awareness, user-set quiet hours  
**Impact:** Notifications feel helpful, not harassing

### Decision 4: Appointment Clustering
**Research trigger:** 9/10 interview participants cited appointment coordination as a major pain point; 40% have 7+ appointments/year  
**Problem:** Scheduling 3–4 specialists requires hours of juggling calendars  
**Solution:** App analyzes work calendar and proposes clustering multiple appointments on the same day  
**Impact:** Sarah's #1 time sink — calendar coordination — is solved automatically

### Decision 5: "Bad Day Mode"
**Research trigger:** Emily (45): "On my worst days, I can barely get out of bed"  
**Problem:** Illness itself makes managing illness harder  
**Solution:** One-tap mode that strips the interface to essentials + auto-notifies designated caregiver  
**Impact:** Users are supported exactly when they need it most

### Decision 6: Accessibility-First, Not Accessibility-Added
**Research trigger:** 56% have some accessibility need  
**Problem:** Accessibility features feel segregated in most apps ("go to accessibility settings")  
**Solution:** Large touch targets, high contrast, and voice reminders are present across all modes — invisible infrastructure that elevates the experience for everyone  
**Impact:** Features designed for Margaret benefit all users under stress, distraction, or low-light conditions

---

## Reflections & Takeaways

### How the Process Worked

The most important insight from this project is that every good design decision was *pulled* out of user research — not invented. Before the interviews, the obvious assumption was that users simply "forget" medication and need a reminder. The research revealed something more nuanced:

- There's a **confirmation problem** (Did I take it?)
- There's an **identification problem** (Which pill is this?)
- There's a **timing problem** (With food? Before breakfast?)
- There's a **complexity problem** (The schedule itself is overwhelming)

If I had designed based on the assumption, I would have built a better alarm clock. Instead, I designed a **confirmation system** — and that's a completely different product.

---

### Challenges & How I Solved Them

**Challenge 1: Designing for both Margaret and Sarah simultaneously**

The two personas have almost opposite needs. Margaret needs extreme simplicity. Sarah needs powerful efficiency features. There's no single interface that satisfies both.

*Solution:* The adaptive three-mode system. Both Margaret and Sarah get a version of the app that feels made for them — because it is.

---

**Challenge 2: Making reminders valuable without being annoying**

The app's core value *is* reminders. But too many reminders is exactly why users abandon apps. This is a genuine design paradox.

*Solution:* Smart escalation — only one gentle reminder initially, escalating to persistent only if ignored. Calendar awareness — no interruptions during detected meetings. User control — full preference configuration during onboarding.

---

**Challenge 3: Keeping the prototype focused**

24 prioritized features and 10+ pain points could easily become a bloated prototype with no coherent experience.

*Solution:* A P0–P3 prioritization matrix. P0 features (must-have for core value) got dedicated screens. P2–P3 features were documented but deferred. The prototype does fewer things — but does them excellently.

---

### 5 Takeaways

1. **Research prevents assumption-driven design.** The "Did I take it?" confirmation feature is the heart of this app — and it never would have existed without user interviews.

2. **Personas are decision tools, not deliverables.** Every time there was a design conflict, asking "Does this work for Margaret?" and "Does this work for Sarah?" resolved it.

3. **Journey maps reveal what wireframes miss.** The emotional stakes of Margaret's first independent morning use only emerged from journey-level thinking — not screen-level design.

4. **Accessibility benefits everyone.** Features designed for the most constrained user (large touch targets, voice reminders) raise the quality bar for all users.

5. **Scope discipline is a design skill.** Knowing what to leave out is as important as knowing what to include.
